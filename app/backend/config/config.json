Also students will develop a way of identifying how the format or medium of a source affects its availability and how it can be used in research. ","introductionToolText":"This tool will allow students to use context clues to determine where a source falls on a specific timeline. There are three main steps to this module. First, students will be given five sources and using context clues will place them along the timeline given and be able to explain their rational for placing the source there. Second, students will compare their answers with another classmate. Last, the student will be able to modify his/her answers.","step1Instructions":"To see a source more clearly and read some information about the source, tap and hold or hover over the image. Once you have done this, try to determine which order you think these sources were published in.  Then, drag and drop the randomly ordered sources on the left onto the timeline on the right to represent your prediction. You may also use the TAB and arrow keys to order the sources.","step2Instructions":"To see a source more clearly and read some information about the source, tap and hold or hover over the image.
